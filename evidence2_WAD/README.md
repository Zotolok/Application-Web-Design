This is my project for Evidence 2. This is just a CRUD project using Laravel simulating a book database where you can add, delete, edit and see the books within the database. The steps for using this project are the following:
1. Have xampp or Laragon installed
2. Install composer for Laravel
3. Put the "evidence2_WAD" in the "htdocs" folder within "xampp" folder (xampp/htdocs/evidence2_WAD)
4. Turn Apache and MySQL on in the xampp control panel
5. Go to a web browser and write "localhost/phpmyadmin" and hopefully you will enter into phpMyAdmin (if that is not the case, you will need to watch some tutorials to solve that issue)
6. Create a new database named "library"
7. Go to another browser tab and write "localhost/evidence2_WAD/public/index" this place is where you can see, create, update and delete the books from the database.

Note: If you are not able to enter to the /index page, go to "localhost/evidence2_WAD/public/create" and add a book, remember to put just numbers in the published year field

With the previous instructions, you will be able to open this project and test it (you can download the .zip i'll leave in this repository or just download the proper files).

Finally, I'd like to give special thanks to my friends for helping me making this project and solve lots of errors at long way. Also, I'd like to make some references to some pages that helped me solve my issues during the development of this project:
