# Who Am I?
Greetings,
I'm Celic Gabriel Hernández Archundia. Currently, I'm a software engineer and I'm on my way to be a frontend developer, too. My main interests are videogames, gym, and personal growth.

# Academic Background
Currently, I'm a studying a software engineering degree in Tecmilenio University; where I'm specializing in Big Data management, mobile apps development and the Frontend and Backend regarding web site development. Also, I have some experience in videogame design and development with Unity using C#, Blender and Gimp.  

# Skills and Tools
Programming languages (and none), design tools or frameworksI'm familiar with:
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
- C#
- C++
- Git
- Swift
- Blender
- Gimp
- Unity
- HTML
- CSS
- Vue.js
- PHP

# Objectives and Goals
My short-term objectives in programming are to enhance my CSS and JavaScript skills by building both junior and advanced projects at school and independently. This will help me become a more proficient programmer, increasing my visibility and recognition.

My long-term objective, aside to learn constantly about JS and other useful programming languages, is to be able to contribute in some manner to the world; my knowledge, how I learn and do hard things, to teach the next generations how to become better humans beings and how to share their knowldege and love to others. I think I want to become a teacher and mentor for my friends and future students after I successfully built a good career and uptimized my skills to the top (and beyond).

# Personal Projects or Contributions
I have built and upload some personal projects in my GitHub so anyone can take a look on that. For example, in my Frontend folder you can find some projects releated to this field. Nevertheless, I need to organize other projects I haven't upload in here so I can show them to you in the future.
